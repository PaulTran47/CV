      \item Compiled an internal memo consisting of BFI and business sentiment survey metrics across private sectors and Federal Reserve regional banks, used by Chairman Powell in his June 2019 press conference (FAME).
      \item Program tighter incorporation of business sentiment, trade exposure, and uncertainty metrics into models that forecast BFI (FAME).

      2017--2018 & \textbf{Research Assistant}, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
    \end{tabular}

    \begin{compactitem}\parskip = 0cm
      \item Excelled in high-pressure role supporting a group of economists charged with assembling the staff's GDP forecast ahead of each FOMC meeting. (FAME, R).
      \item Assisting in expanding the FRB's forecasting apparatus to directly account for measurement error's role in published statistics when determining the true, underlying cyclical position of the economy (FAME, R).
      \item Created new exhibits highlighting the estimates of the cyclical position of the economy through variables such as GDP, potential output, output gap, \& measurement error in the \href{https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc_historical.htm#tealbooks}{\textit{Tealbook A: ``Economic and Financial Conditions: Current Situation and Outlook''}} and the \href{https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc_historical.htm#greenbooks}{\textit{Greenbooks: ``Current Economic and Financial Condition''}} (FAME).

  \section{Ongoing Research Papers}
    ~\begin{tabular}{lP{15cm}}
      2019--& \textit{``New Orders and Shipments of Capital Goods by Manufacturers: Better Forecasting Using} \textit{High-frequency Business Sentiment Survey Data"}, with Eugenio Pinto.
    \end{tabular}

    \begin{compactitem}\parskip = 0cm
      \item Coded in Fame.
      \item Created two VAR models for in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting, with the base model consisting of only total shipments and total new orders, whilst the alternative model included the weekly-frequency business sentiment survey index from Evercore-ISI.
      \item Found our alternative model to perform better at forecasting investment at business cycle turning points, and had smaller forecast errors at most time horizons.

    ~\begin{tabular}{lP{15cm}}
      2018--& \textit{``The Story Chain Index: High-frequency Record Updates Linkage Across Time with No Metadata"}, with Andrew C. Chang and Sarah Adler.
    \end{tabular}

    \begin{compactitem}\parskip = 0cm
      \item Coded in Bash, Python, and (P)SQL.
      \item Developed algorithm that performs general semantic text matching to link high-frequency records across time, in situations where the contents of records are updated, but no meta data to link the records exist.
      \item General semantic text algorithm created from string similarities derived from Levenshtein and Jaquard string distances and record timestamps.
      \item Programmed scripts that filtered and chronologically nearly ten million US-centric news item from the linked Thomson Reuters News Archive (TRNA) at the daily frequency.
      \item Constructed a daily flexible news coverage frequency index for any given number of news topics from the linked TRNA.
