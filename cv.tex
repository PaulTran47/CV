      2018-- & \textbf{Senior Research Assistant}, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
    \end{tabular}

    \begin{compactitem}\parskip = 0cm
      \item {[Bash, FAME, SAS]} Assist group of economists tasked with assembling staff's forecasts for U.S. business fixed investment (BFI) ahead of each Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.
      \item {[FAME]} Compiled an internal memo consisting of BFI and business sentiment survey metrics across private sectors and Federal Reserve regional banks, used by Chairman Powell in his June 2019 press conference.
      \item {[Bash, FAME, (P)SQL, SAS]} Calculated relationship between industry-level capital expenditure growth rates from Compustat with metrics of trade exposure and uncertainty with China and other countries. Metrics were published in an internal cross-division FRB memo.
      \item {[FAME]} Implemented tighter incorporation of business sentiment, profit expectations, trade exposure, and uncertainty metrics into models that forecast BFI.

    ~\begin{tabular}{llP{15cm}}
      2017--2018 & \textbf{Research Assistant}, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
    \end{tabular}

    \begin{compactitem}\parskip = 0cm
      \item {[FAME, R]} Excelled in high-pressure role supporting a group of economists charged with assembling the staff's GDP forecast ahead of each FOMC meeting.
      \item {[FAME, R]} Developed programmes used by FRB staff that expanded the FRB's forecasting apparatus to directly account for measurement error's role in published statistics when determining the true, underlying cyclical position of the economy.
      \item {[FAME]} Created new exhibits highlighting the estimates of the cyclical position of the economy through variables such as GDP, potential output, output gap, \& measurement error in the \href{https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc_historical.htm#tealbooks}{\textit{Tealbook A: ``Economic and Financial Conditions: Current Situation and Outlook''}} and the \href{https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc_historical.htm#greenbooks}{\textit{Greenbooks: ``Current Economic and Financial Condition''}}.
      % \item {[FAME, R]} Investigated relationship between statistical discrepancy and overall revisions to real GDP growth from the BEA; any changes to this relationship; and related reasons.

  \section{Ongoing Research Projects}
    ~\begin{tabular}{lP{15cm}}
      2019--& \textit{``New Orders and Shipments of Capital Goods by Manufacturers: Better Forecasting Using} \textit{High-frequency Business Sentiment Survey Data"} {[FAME]}, with Eugenio Pinto.
    \end{tabular}

    \begin{compactitem}\parskip = 0cm
      \item Created two VAR models for in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting, with the base model consisting of only total shipments and total new orders, whilst the alternative model included the weekly-frequency business sentiment survey index from Evercore-ISI.
      \item Found our alternative model to perform better at forecasting investment at business cycle turning points, and had smaller forecast errors at most time horizons.

    ~\begin{tabular}{lP{15cm}}
      2018--& \textit{``The Story Chain Index: High-frequency Record Updates Linkage Across Time with No}\\
      & \textit{Metadata"} {[Bash, Python, (P)SQL]}, with Andrew C. Chang and Sarah Adler.
    \end{tabular}

    \begin{compactitem}\parskip = 0cm
      \item Developed algorithm that performs general semantic text matching to link high-frequency records across time, in situations where the contents of records are updated, but no meta data to link the records exist.
      \item General semantic text algorithm created from string similarities derived from Levenshtein and Jaquard string distances and record timestamps.
      \item Programmed framework that filtered and chronologically nearly ten million US-centric news item from the linked Thomson Reuters News Archive (TRNA) at the daily frequency.
      \item Constructed a daily flexible news coverage frequency index for any given number of news topics from the linked TRNA.
